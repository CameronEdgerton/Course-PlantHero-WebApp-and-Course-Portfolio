# DECO7180---Design-Computing-Studio-1

This course involved a group project where we had to build a website and utilise a dataset from the QLD government database. 

My team decided to build a webtool that made it easy for users to identify the types of waterwise plants that would thrive in their yard (based on light needs, soil type, size limitations etc).

The portfolio is a reflection of the course.
